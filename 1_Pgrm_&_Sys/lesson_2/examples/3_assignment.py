# You can bind a variable name to a value with a Assignment Statement
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements

# a_variable is the name
# 5 is the value
a_variable = 5

# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#unary-arithmetic-and-bitwise-operations
# You can use the unary operation - to create a negative integer
negative_value = -1

# You can rebind a variable
a_variable = "hello world"
a_variable = 5

# You can bind another_variable
another_variable = 5 + 2

# a_variable + another_variable is a expression and it will be evaluated before assignment
the_third_variable = a_variable + another_variable

# You can assign multiple variable in one line
x = y = z = 2
