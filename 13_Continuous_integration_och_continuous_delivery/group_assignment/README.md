# PingURL v0.6 - URL Monitoring Service

PingURL is a RESTful service designed to monitor and perform periodic checks on specified URLs.

## Pre-commit

We use pre-commits.
These do the normal kind of checks

- black
- ~~pylint~~
- ~~pytest~~
- isort

on every commit
If one of the checks fail then you're not allowed to commit and you have to retry commiting after you have fixed the issues.

to use pre-commit:

1. Make a venv in the root of the project

`python -m venv venv`

2. Install requirements to said venv

`pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`

3. Install pre-commit hook

`pre-commit install`

- You should see this message: `pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit`

4. Now you can make commits as usual, but checks will happen at every commit

## Backend

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or greater is required.

### Getting Started

#### VS Code Setup

To set up your environment with Visual Studio Code, follow these instructions:

1. Open the repository in VS Code which utilizes the `.vscode` directory at the root.
2. Install the recommended extensions that pop up upon opening.
3. Use "Python: Create Environment..." to set up a `.venv` at the root for local development, despite the backend directory being preferable for isolated Docker use.

#### Setting up the virtual environment

Before running the application, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project's root directory.

```bash
cd path/to/pingurl/backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment in the `backend` directory.

```bash
# On macOS and Linux:
python3 -m venv venv

# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment.

```bash
# On macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies required for the project to run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running the Application

Once the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask application using:

```bash
# Make sure your current working directory is the backend directory if you're not already there
cd backend

# Run the application
flask run
```

The application should now be running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for interacting with the PingURL service:

### Add a Watched URL

- `POST /watched-urls`: Add a new URL to be watched.
  - Payload: JSON object containing `activateAt` (ISO 8601 date-time string), `force` (boolean), `periodSec` (integer, minimum 10), and `url` (valid URL string).
  - Returns: JSON object with `message` indicating success and `urlId` of the added URL.
  - Status codes: 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request).

Example request body:

```json
{
  "activateAt": "2023-11-06T01:36:28.610Z",
  "force": true,
  "periodSec": 30,
  "url": "http://example.com"
}
```

#### Delete a Watched URL

- `DELETE /watched-urls/{urlId}`: Remove a watched URL by its ID.
  - Returns: JSON object with a `message` indicating the URL has been removed.
  - Status codes: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found).

#### Get Watched URL Data

- `GET /watched-urls/{urlId}`: Retrieve data for a specific watched URL by its ID.
  - Status codes:
    - `200 (OK)`: The data for the watched URL was successfully retrieved.
    - `404 (Not Found)`: No data could be found for the provided URL ID.
  - Returns: A JSON object with the following structure:
    - `activateAt`: A timestamp in ISO 8601 format indicating when monitoring of the URL is scheduled to start.
    - `force`: A boolean indicating whether the monitoring process was initiated even when the creation request failed.
    - `periodSec`: The interval in seconds at which the URL is checked.
    - `pings`: An array of ping objects, each containing:
      - `pingedAt`: The timestamp of when the ping was executed.
      - `responseTimeSec`: The response time for the ping, in seconds.
      - `statusCode`: The HTTP status code received in response to the ping.
    - `url`: The URL that is being monitored.
    - `urlId`: The unique identifier for the watched URL.

Example request response:

```json
{
    "activateAt": "2023-11-06T02:35:05.923000+00:00",
    "force": false,
    "periodSec": 10,
    "pings": [
        {
            "pingedAt": "2023-11-09T03:57:13+00:00",
            "responseTimeSec": 0.052734,
            "statusCode": 200
        },
        {
            "pingedAt": "2023-11-09T03:57:23+00:00",
            "responseTimeSec": 0.052734,
            "statusCode": 200
        },
    ],
    "url": "http://google.com",
    "urlId": 1
}
```

#### Get All Watched URL IDs

- `GET /watched-urls`: Retrieves a list of IDs for all URLs currently under monitoring.
  - Status codes:
    - `200 (OK)`: The list of watched URL IDs was successfully retrieved.
  - Returns: A JSON object with the following structure:
    - `urlIds`: An array consisting of integer IDs, each uniquely identifying a watched URL.

Example request response:

```json
{
    "urlIds": [1, 2]
}
```

This example shows that there are two URLs being monitored, with the IDs 1 and 2.

#### Get Statistics

- `GET /stats`: Retrieve aggregate statistics about the watched URLs.
  - Status codes:
    - `200 (OK)`: Successfully retrieved statistics about the watched URLs.
  - Returns: A JSON object with the following data:
    - `pings`: The total count of pings that have been sent to monitored URLs.
    - `watchedUrls`: The number of unique URLs that are currently being monitored.

Example request response:

```json
{
    "pings": 12,
    "watchedUrls": 2
}
```

In this example, the response indicates that a total of 12 pings have been executed across 2 monitored URLs.
