# Exercise 11

In this exercise we will learn packing and unpacking structs.

## Struct

Do the following steps:

1. Create a struct format
2. Create a test data byte e.g

   ```python
   "hello world".encode() # b'hello world'
   b"a"*10 # b'aaaaaaaaaa'
   ```

3. Pack the struct
4. Inspect the struct with the debugger or print
5. Unpack the struct

For the following types:

1. A command of 1 char
2. A string with maximum 100 chars
3. A command of 1 char followed by a string of maximum 100 chars
4. A longer string with maximum 3000 chars
