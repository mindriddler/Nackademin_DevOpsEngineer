## Installation of Java 17 LTS

There is a `JRE` (Java Runtime Environment) and `JDK` (Java Development Kit), since we are developing java applications we need the `JDK`.

LTS means Long Term Support. The latest JDK is Java SE 19, but we can stick with the 17 version.

```bash
# On mac
brew update
brew install openjdk@17
# Read the message carefully, you will need to add a symlink and export to PATH
```
Or go to: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-mac

- Windows - Oracle [Java Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/index.html)


There may be other versions of Java already installed. Double check your version by typing `java --version` into a terminal. 

## Java 17

I recommend that you read the Oracle tutorial, and that you get familiar with the docs pages for Java. We will use them in the course to lookup usage, types, interfaces, inheritance and parameters.
