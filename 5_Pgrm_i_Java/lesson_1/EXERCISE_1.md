# Exercise 1

## Instructions

The main goal of this exercise is to learn how to hand in a exercise. We will verify that Git, Visual Studio Code, GitHub and Java works properly on your environment. You will also learn how to use markdown, a lightweight markup language commonly used in i.e GitHub, GitLab both for docs and to comment i.e `pull requests`.

### `Exercise` Java in Visual Studio Code

We have previously used Visual Studio Code for Python Development. Now we need to adjust it to work well with Java. You will follow the [java tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial) by VS Code. *NOTE* You can use the Java Coding pack for java to install the JDK 11 and required plugins. If you want to have the latest Java 17 you can install it manually and then just install the extensions.

### Part 1

Create a hello world program in  that runs with the `run` button in VS Code.

1. Create a file named `FirstHello.java`
2. Create a class with the same name FirstHello
3. Print "hello world!"

### Part 2

Create a hello world program with multiple lines of code e.g multiple prints

1. Create a file named `DebugHello.java`
2. Create a class with the name DebugHello
3. Add multiple prints or code of your choice
4. Add a breakpoint
5. Run the program with the `run and debug` or the `debug` button (F5).

### `Exercise` git

Make sure you have a functional git installation.

```bash
git --version 
```

### `Exercise` Java JDK

```bash
java --version
javac --version
```

## Hand in instructions

In the repository [devops22-java](https://github.com/fictive-reality/devops22-java)

1. Provide a screenshot showing Git and Java version 11 or 17.
2. Provide a screenshot successfully running "hello world"
3. Provide a screenshot successfully debugging your application.

### General instructions

- Create a branch with name `YOURUSERNAME_lesson_1`

Hand in your exercise in a `Pull Request` that contains screenshot[s] and file[s]. You can also use the feature `attach a file` for screenshots in your `Pull Request`
