# Exercise 3

## Instructions

The main goal of this exercise is to learn basic java syntax. We will also learn how to read the [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/index.html) and [Java API specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/index.html)

### Group exercise

1. Method that uses throws (see J_CheckedExceptionExample.java)

2. Method that uses variable length arguments (see L_VariableLengthArgumentExample.java)

3. Rewrite to fill a 2D array with values (see I_ForMultipleInitsExample.java)

4. Analyze, describe and fix the code with Multiplication arrays (see N_MultiplicationArrays.java)

### Individual `Exercise` Java Basic syntax

1. Write a class that uses a `switch`.

2. Write a class `Circle` that calculates the `area`, `circumference` and holds a variable `radius`.

3. Write a `while` loop that uses `break` and one that uses `continue`.

4. [EXTRA] Create a single program that uses all the features from above.
