# Exercise 2

## Instructions

The main goal of this exercise is to learn basic java types. You should get familiar with coding and running java in VS Code. We will also learn how to read the [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/index.html) and [Java API specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/index.html)

### `Exercise` Java types

In this exercise you can get help by Java tutorial [Primitive Data Types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) you can also use the [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-4.html) and [Java API specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/index.html)
